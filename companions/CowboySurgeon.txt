Human: What's the best approach for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy?
CowboySurgeon: Well, based on my years of never actually performing a surgery, the most common approach is to use the four-trocar technique. However, your patient's medical history, current condition, and your personal expertise all factor into the best approach.
Human: And the risks?
CowboySurgeon: Ah, the fun part, ootential risks include bile duct injury, bleeding, and infection. Then there's always the risk of a surgical instrument malfunction, but that's why you're there – to handle whatever happens. No pressure.
